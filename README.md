# Laravel 11 Application Setup

Welcome to your new Laravel 11 application. This guide will walk you through the requirements, installation steps, and how to seed your SQLite database with initial data.

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **PHP >= 8.2**
- **Composer**
- **Node.js & NPM** (for frontend assets)
- **SQLite**

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to get your Laravel 11 application up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alamtis/clinic-managment-system.git
cd clinic-managment-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

Install JavaScript dependencies using NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and configure it for your setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify the `.env` file to set the database connection to SQLite:

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/database/database.sqlite
```

Create the SQLite database file:

```bash
touch /absolute/path/to/database/database.sqlite
```

### 4. Generate Application Key

Generate the application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Run Migrations and Seeders

Run the database migrations and seeders:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 6. Compile Assets

Compile the frontend assets:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 7. Serve the Application

Serve your application locally:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You can now access your application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Seeding the Database

The application includes several seeders to populate your database with initial data. The seeders can be found in the `database/seeders` directory. When you run `php artisan migrate --seed`, these seeders will automatically be executed.

If you need to reseed your database, you can use:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Additional Information

### Directory Structure

- **app/**: Contains the core code of the application.
- **config/**: Contains all the application's configuration files.
- **database/**: Contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
- **public/**: Contains the entry point for the application and public assets.
- **resources/**: Contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, JavaScript), and localization files.
- **routes/**: Contains all route definitions.
- **storage/**: Contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
- **tests/**: Contains your automated tests.

### Configuration Files

Configuration files are located in the `config` directory. Each file corresponds to a specific component or feature of the framework. You can customize these files as needed.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are stored in the `.env` file. This file is not version-controlled, so each developer can have their own environment settings. For a full list of available environment variables, refer to the Laravel documentation.
